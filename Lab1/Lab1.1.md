# Lab 1.1:

## What criteria should be used in choosing an appropriate requirements engineering tool?

Carrillo de Gea et al. (2021) provided a list of 17 items to be used in the evaluation of RE tool capabilities:

- Organization of requirements with metadata, attributes, and reuse
- Reports, database queries, and open interface language
- Internal checks, that is, consistency, dependencies, and history
- Traceability support, that is, drag and drop (horizontal and vertical)
- Providing support for reuse
- Remote working, cloud only
- Multiple views of requirements
- Performance
- Collaboration, workflow management
- Easily adapted and integrated into business processes
- Federation and notification with ALM/PLM tools
- Export/import with standard formats
- Macros for repeated commands
- Training and learning curve effort
- Agile, CI/CD, and DevOps
- Intelligent support
- Scalability

This checklist (or an adapted version) and an appropriate consensus management
approach (e.g., Wideband Delphi, AHP) can be used to select the right tool for a
team or enterprise.

## Are there any drawbacks to using certain tools in requirements engineering activities?

- Tools are becoming increasingly complex and difficult to use.
- Validation functionalities such as consistency, correctness, and
  completeness are still lacking in most of the tools.

## When selecting an open-source tool, what characteristics should you look for?

- Functionality: The tool should have the necessary features for your specific use case. For instance, if you're working on a project that involves brainstorming and prioritizing features, you might want a tool that supports mind mapping, like FreeMind.
- Integration: The tool should be able to integrate with other systems. This is especially important if you're working on a complex project that involves multiple systems. For example, in Phil's smart home system, he wanted the security and HVAC systems to work with the smart home system.
- Ease of Use: The tool should be user-friendly and easy to learn. This can make the process of requirements engineering more efficient and less time-consuming.
- Collaboration Features: If you're working with a team, it's important to choose a tool that supports collaboration.
- Test Case Execution: It would be beneficial if the tool has an ability to execute test cases. FitNesse, for instance, allows for test case execution. When the actual code is developed, upon clicking a button, the results of the corresponding function will be calculated.
- Flexibility and Scalability: The tool should be able to handle the complexity and size of your project. It should also be flexible enough to evolve with the project as it grows and changes.

## How can tools enable distributed, global requirements engineering activities? What are the drawbacks in this regard?

- Benefits:
  - Increase efficiency and productivity: Tools can help to automate tasks such as requirements gathering, analysis, and traceability, which can free up team members to focus on more strategic activities.
  - Improve quality of requirements: Tools can help to improve the quality of requirements by providing features such as conflict detection, ambiguity checking, and verification support.
  - Reduced risk: Tools can help to reduce the risk of errors and omissions by providing a systematic approach to requirements engineering.
- Drawbacks:
  - Security: Tools may not be secure, which could put sensitive requirements data at risk.
  - Cost: Tools can be expensive to purchase and maintain.
  - Integration: Tools may not integrate well with each other, which can make it difficult to manage the requirements engineering process.
  - Complexity: Some tools can be complex and difficult to use, which can lead to errors.

## If an environment does not currently engage in solid requirements engineering practices, should tools be introduced?

- Introducing tools to an environment that does not currently engage in solid requirements engineering practices can be a beneficial step, but it should be done with careful consideration and a structured approach and follow certain best practices.

## What sort of problems might you find through a traceability matrix that you might not see without one?

- Missing Requirements: Test cases or design documents without referenced requirements.
- Unimplemented requirements: A traceability matrix can show which requirements have been implemented and which have not.
- Incomplete requirements: A traceability matrix can show which requirements have not been traced to any other artifacts, such as design documents, test cases, or user stories.
- Conflicting requirements: A traceability matrix can show which requirements conflict with each other.
- Unverified Requirements: The matrix can reveal requirements that lack traceability links to corresponding test cases or design elements. This indicates that certain requirements have not been verified, potentially leading to defects and quality issues.
- Impact Analysis: The impact of changes on requirements, test cases, and stakeholders.

## How is AI being proposed for knowledge acquisition and representation in requirements specifications?

- Natural Language Processing: NLP can be used to extract requirements from natural language text, such as user stories, use cases, and business requirements. This can help to automate the process of requirements gathering and analysis, and to identify potential conflicts and ambiguities in the requirements.
- Knowledge graphs: Knowledge graphs can be used to represent and organize knowledge about requirements, such as the relationships between different requirements, the constraints, and the assumptions underlying requirements. This can help to improve the understanding and communication of requirements, and to support automated reasoning about requirements.
- Machine learning: ML can be used to learn patterns in requirements data, such as the relationships between different requirements and the likelihood of certain requirements being changed. This information can then be used to improve the quality and completeness of requirements specifications, and to identify and prioritize risks.
- Semantic Analysis: AI techniques, such as semantic analysis, can be used to represent requirements using structured, machine-readable formats. This makes it easier to search, and analyze requirements, as well as establish semantic relationships between different requirements.
- Recommendation Systems: AI can suggest relevant requirements or design decisions based on the project context and historical data.
